# GoodreadsFilter
<p> Filter exported GoodReads libraries by applying filters such as "Author", "date-added", "title", "year published", etc.

To expound upon that brief explanation, GoodreadsFilter allows you to filter the data associated with your Goodreads account by a specified filter (Author) and filter constraint (George R.R. Martin). Each filter is associated with a filter constraint and you are allowed to select multiple pairs when you choose to filter your Goodreads data.

You will need to [export your GoodReads library data](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-do-I-import-or-export-my-books-1553870934590) to use this tool.</p>
